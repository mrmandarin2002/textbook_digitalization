#####
#the scanner class is how the program detects input from the barcode
#also where data regarding the specifics of the scanned barcode is procssed
#basic idea for barcode detection is that since the barcode scanner sends input as keyboard...
#we can basically have a temporary string that keeps track of keyboard inputs. This string clears...
#every time more than 40 milliseconds elapses between inputs
