General Notes:

The purpose of the overall project is to record the withdrawls and returns of school textbooks using
barcode scanners and a centralized database. The idea came from the teacher in charge of textbooks
and my friend and I, being the only two students in grade twelve computer science this year,
convinced our teacher to dedicate our entire first term to this project.

The front end, including barcode scanning, is being developed by a friend of mine using JavaFX

Most of the server is written in Python3 with interaction between the database and the server
code being through the sqlite3 module from the Python standard library.
Under my model this most of the math for deposit changes would be handled in the Python code.

Connection between server and client is through a connectionless UDP socket.
TCP would probably be a better option but the logic is so much easier that I'm probably going
to stick to a connectionless system unless doing so is a sin against backend development.
